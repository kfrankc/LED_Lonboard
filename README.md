This repository contains the codebase for my LED Longboard project.

* The folder `LEDBoard` contains the Arduino code to drive my [Adafruit Neopixel LEDs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1138). 
* The folder `AndroidApp` contains the code for the Android application that connects via Bluetooth to my bluetooth module, which in turn allows me to control the LED color via the app.
